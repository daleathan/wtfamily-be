WTFamily TODO
=============

Goals
-----

- This is a publishing system.  Only displays info, no editing.

  - This is subject to change.
  - Gramps was intended to be the editor, but it's too hard to use.

- It *may* evolve and eventually get editing capabilities in a distant future.
- YAML is bad for backend but great for source control purposes.

  - Replaced with MongoDB because it was *too* bad for backend.
  - Regular exports to XML with predictable order of tags and attributes should
    address the problem of source control.

- An ETL layer for GrampsXML import/export.

  - Compatibility with other formats through Gramps.

Import/Export
-------------

- [ ] Unify models with validation schemata.
- [ ] Add ETL option: delete local items not found in imported data
- [x] Export to GrampsXML
- [ ] Export to GEDCOM

Access Control
--------------

- [ ] Hide information marked as private unless a certain HTTP header is present

Linked Entities Management
--------------------------

- [ ] CLI tool to create files with pre-filled boilerplate + auto-update related ones

  e.g. `add person --fullname=John\ Doe --child-of=alice --father-of=peter`
  or `add event --who=john_doe --what=birth --where=london --source=citation123`

- [ ] CLI tool to link existing entities without editor

  e.g. `update person john_doe --child-of=alice_doe --born=est\ 1775`

Web interface
-------------

- [x] Async UI with RESTful service

  - Strategy for family tree: fetch and cache the whole /family/ list
    (it's lightweight), then fetch individuals via /person/?ids=foo,bar
    as needed

- Might be useful:

  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/semantic-ui-dropdown-canjs

Visualisation
-------------

Fan/Sunbirst Chart

    http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4348373 â€” zoomable sunburst

    more than just zoom, very useful.
    not sure about text but perhaps it can be added somehow.

Research Tool Features
----------------------

- Researcher's Diary
- `Waiting For...` tracking
- Grouped primary questions to answer (?)
- Tools directory.  These are mainly websites/repositories.
  Grouped and annotated URLs; sources can be linked to the tools.
  Action items might be bound to tools.
