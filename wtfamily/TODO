- [ ] Remove hlinks, use IDs.

      challenges:

      - forward-looking hlink→ID resolver

        - perhaps as a final step, outside of the converter?
          it would just register the mappings on an external visitor object)

          - we'll also need to go *into* the items.  They should be flat-ish, i.e.
            each item is a dictionary where values can be single or multiple.
            This is defined by schema.
            So we just iterate the list if the field isn't in SINGLE_VALUE_FIELDS.

            General pattern::

                fooref:
                - {hlink: x, quux: 1}
                barref:
                - {hlink: y, quux: 2}

            Should we just add ID to that?

      - some entities (e.g. namemaps) don't have IDs

        - currently using UUID but not sure if it's ok

- [x] Split items into separate YAML files.
- [ ] Refactor.
- [ ] Unify models with validation schemata.
- [ ] Add ETL option: delete local items not found in imported data
- [ ] Caching.  (implement as late as possible.)

    more than just zoom, very useful.
    not sure about text but perhaps it can be added somehow.
